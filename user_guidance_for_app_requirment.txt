1.this app is designed with FastAPI architechture,sqlalchemy,pydantic,react to create web application for data collection 
2.this app use for small project with records of fabrication inspection of material inspection,fit up inspection, final inspection, and NDT Request
3.user management and data records are required depend user authorization, admin user is allow to add new user, delete invalid user, and user re validation(defined valid perioud is 90 days)
4.the data base for material inspection will be 'Type of material','material grade','Thickness','Dia for pipe','heat_no','MVR report no', and 'unique_piece_id'.
5.the fit up inspection records will have the columns of 'drawing no','system spec','line no','spool no','joint no','weld type','part1-unique_piece_id','part2-unique_piece_id','inspection result','inspection date','inspection operator','inspection remark',the'part1-unique_piece_id' and 'part2-unique_piece_id' are linked with material inspection column 'unique_piece_id',
when user input the 'unique_piece_id', system will automatically search the material inspection records and display the material inspection 'heat_no','thickness','MVR report no' for part1 and part2 in fit up inspection records.
6.the final inspection records will have the columns of 'drawing no','system spec','line no','spool no','joint no','weld type',inherit from fit up inspection, and add additional column of 'wps no','welder no','inspection date','final report no','NDT-RT','NDT-PT,'NDT-MT',which will indicate which type of ndt to apply after final inspection.
7.NDT Request records will have the columns of 'line no','spool no','joint no','weld type','thickness','dia','weld no','weld process','NDT-RT remark','NDT-PT remark','NDT-MT remark','NDT-RFI Date','RFI-NO'
8.the user can search the records with 'line no','spool no','joint no',concated string as uniq_joint_no as primary key use for fit upinspection,final inspection and ndt request data searching and look up index in data query.
9.the user can export the records as csv file.
10.the user can import the records from csv file.
11.the user can delete the records.
12.the user can update the records.
13.the user can view the records.
14.the user can login and logout.
15.the user can register.
16.the user can reset the password.
17.the user can change the email.
18.the user can change the username.
19.the user can change the role.
20.the user can view the user profile.
21.the user can view the user list.
22.the user can view the user role.
23.the user can view the user email.
24.the user can view the user username.
25.the user can view the user password.
26.the user can view the user list by role.
27.the user can view the user list by email.
28.the user can view the user list by username.
29.the user can view the user list by password.
30.the user can view the user list by role,email,username,password.
31.the log in page will only display user access with user name and pass code,and able to remind if log in failure.
32 after user login, the page will navigate to dashboard.html, and the material inspection,fit up inspection,final inspection and NDT Request all are ableto quick link from dashboard.html.
