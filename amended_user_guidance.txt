# Application Requirements Overview

## Application Architecture
- The application is designed using the FastAPI architecture.

## Application Purpose
- This application is intended for managing records of fabrication inspections, including material inspection, fit-up inspection, final inspection, and NDT requests.

## User Management
- User management and data records are dependent on user authorization.
- Admin users can add new users, delete invalid users, and perform user re-validation (valid period is 90 days).

## Database Schema Requirements

### Material Inspection
- Columns: Type of material, material grade, Thickness, Diameter for pipe, heat_no, MVR report no, unique_piece_id.

### Fit-Up Inspection
- Columns: drawing no, system spec, line no, spool no, joint no, weld type, part1-unique_piece_id, part2-unique_piece_id, inspection result, inspection date, inspection operator, inspection remark.
- Linked with material inspection's unique_piece_id for automatic retrieval of heat_no, thickness, MVR report no.

### Final Inspection
- Columns: drawing no, system spec, line no, spool no, joint no, weld type (inherited from fit-up inspection), wps no, welder no, inspection date, final report no, NDT-RT, NDT-PT, NDT-MT.

### NDT Request
- Columns: line no, spool no, joint no, weld type, thickness, dia, weld no, weld process, NDT-RT remark, NDT-PT remark, NDT-MT remark, NDT-RFI Date, RFI-NO.

## Data Search and Manipulation
- Users can search records using line no, spool no, joint no, and a concatenated string uniq_joint_no as the primary key.
- Users can export records as CSV files.
- Users can import records from CSV files.
- Users can delete, update, and view records.

## User Functionalities
- Login and logout capabilities.
- User registration.
- Password reset.
- Email, username, and role changes.
- Viewing user profiles, lists, roles, emails, usernames, and passwords.
- Viewing user lists filtered by role, email, username, or password.

## Login and Navigation
- The login page will display user access with username and password and remind users of login failures.
- After login, the page will navigate to dashboard.html, providing quick links to material inspection, fit-up inspection, final inspection, and NDT Request.

## Additional Notes
- The application will use SQLite database as indicated by the provided commands.
